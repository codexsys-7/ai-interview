### ✅ Dual-Mode ATS Scoring (Core Feature)

#### 🔹 Mode A — Resume Only
Evaluates **general ATS readiness**:
- Searchability (contact info, links)
- ATS essentials (sections, bullets)
- Content quality (skills, metrics)
- Recruiter best practices

#### 🔹 Mode B — Resume + Job Description
Evaluates **job match + readiness**:
- Hard skill overlap (Jobscan-style)
- Responsibility alignment (Enhancv-style)
- Seniority match
- Missing keyword detection

➡️ ATS scores are **deterministic**, repeatable, and not random.

---

## 🔑 Authentication System (Signup, Login, Logout)

#### 1. Signup Functionality

We implemented a complete user registration system using FastAPI on the backend and React on the frontend.
What was added:
- A dedicated Signup page with a clean, modern UI matching the app’s blue/white theme.
- Form fields for Full Name, Email, and Password.
- Client-side validation and loading states.
- Backend endpoint /api/auth/signup.

#### Backend logic:
- Validates password length (minimum 8 characters).
- Enforces bcrypt’s 72-byte password limit to prevent runtime crashes.
- Hashes passwords securely using passlib + bcrypt.
- Generates a unique user ID using UUID.
- Stores user credentials safely in the database.
- Issues a JWT token upon successful signup.
##### Why this matters:
- Prevents plain-text password storage.
- Makes the platform safe for real users.
- Lays the foundation for user-specific interview history and analytics.

#### 2. Login Functionality
We added a secure login flow for returning users.
What was added:
- A Login page visually aligned with Signup.
- Backend endpoint /api/auth/login.
- JWT-based authentication.
##### Backend logic:
- Verifies user email.
- Compares entered password with the stored bcrypt hash.
- Issues a new JWT token on success.
##### Frontend behavior:
- Stores authToken and authUser in localStorage.
- Redirects authenticated users to the main application.
- Shows meaningful error messages for invalid credentials.
##### Why this matters:
- Enables session-based access control.
- Ensures only authenticated users can access interview features.

#### 3. Logout Functionality
We implemented a clean and predictable logout mechanism, integrated directly into the navbar.
What was added:
- A Logout button in the navbar.
##### On click:
- Clears authToken and authUser.
- Clears cached interview/session data.
- Redirects the user to the Login page.
##### Security behavior:
- Once logged out, protected routes are immediately inaccessible.
- Manual URL access to /home, /interview, etc. is blocked.
##### Why this matters:
- Prevents stale sessions.
- Ensures user privacy.
- Required for any real-world, multi-user application.

---

#### 4. Route Protection & Auth Gate
We refactored routing to behave like a real production app.
Key changes:
- Introduced an Auth Gate at /.
- If logged in → redirect to /home
- If not logged in → redirect to /login
- Moved the actual dashboard to /home.
- Protected all app routes using a ProtectedRoute wrapper.
- Ensured Login and Signup pages do not show navbar/footer.
##### Why this matters:
- First-time users always see Login/Signup.
- Logged-in users get a seamless experience.
- Prevents accidental access to protected pages.

---

#### 5. Navbar Enhancements
We improved the navbar to reflect authentication state.
##### What was added:
- Display text: “Logged in as <User Name>”
- Reads user details from localStorage.
- Responsive behavior (hidden on small screens).
- Integrated Logout button.

##### Why this matters:
- Confirms to the user which account they are using.
- Adds polish and professionalism to the UI.

---

## 📥 PDF Download for Feedback (Major Feature)

#### 6. Download Feedback as PDF
We added a one-click PDF export feature on the Feedback page.
##### What was added:
- “Download PDF” button.
- Client-side PDF generation using jsPDF and jsPDF-AutoTable.
##### PDF contents include:
- Interview metadata (role, difficulty, date).
- Overall interview score and summary.
- Key strengths and improvement areas.
- Question-by-question breakdown:
- Question text
- User answer
- Scores
- Strengths
- Improvement suggestions

##### Why frontend PDF generation was chosen:
- Faster user experience.
- No backend load.
- Works immediately in the browser.
- No email or storage dependency.

##### Why this matters:
- Users can save/share feedback.
- Makes the app feel complete and professional.
- Essential for real interview preparation tools.

## 🧪 Test Suite

#### **Test Coverage: 75%+**

All new services have comprehensive test suites with proper mocking.

### **Test Files Created:**

| File | Test Cases | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `test_embedding_service.py` | 14 | Embedding generation, similarity calculation |
| `test_conversation_context.py` | 14 | Context building, topic extraction |
| `test_contradiction_detector.py` | 13 | Contradiction detection, follow-up generation |
| `test_semantic_search_api.py` | 10 | Search API endpoints |
| `test_answer_storage.py` | 6 | Answer submission and retrieval |

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

#### 1. Embedding Storage Strategy
**Decision:** Store as JSON string in TEXT column
**Rationale:**
- Supabase PostgreSQL supports JSON natively
- No need for pgvector extension
- Simpler deployment and migration
- Adequate performance for session-scoped queries

#### 2. Embedding Model Choice
**Decision:** `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)
**Rationale:**
- Lower cost than ada-002
- Better performance on retrieval tasks
- Sufficient dimensionality for semantic search

#### 3. Database-First Architecture
**Decision:** Store answers immediately, not at session end
**Rationale:**
- Enables real-time follow-up generation
- Supports mid-interview analysis
- Prevents data loss on browser close
- Required for contradiction detection

#### 4. Async Contradiction Detection
**Decision:** Use async functions with OpenAI
**Rationale:**
- Non-blocking API calls
- Better performance for multiple similarity checks
- Scales well with concurrent interviews

---

## 📊 Key Features

2. **AI analyzes** → Quality, patterns, contradictions
3. **Decision engine** → Determines next action
4. **Question generated** → Contextual, intelligent
5. **TTS converts** → Natural voice response
6. **Frontend displays** → Visual + audio feedback

--- 

## 📈 Performance

- Audio generation: <2 seconds
- Pattern detection: Real-time
- Semantic search: <500ms

---

## 📌 Summary

Phase 1 and 1.2 establish the intelligent memory foundation for two-way interview communication:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Real-time Storage | Immediate answer persistence |
| Embeddings | Semantic understanding of answers |
| Semantic Search | Find relevant previous answers |
| Context Building | AI-ready conversation summaries |
| Contradiction Detection | Ensure interview consistency |
| Test Suite | 75%+ coverage with proper mocking |

The system is now ready for dynamic, context-aware interview experiences.
